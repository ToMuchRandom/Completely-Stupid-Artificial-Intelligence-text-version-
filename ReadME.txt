/dau (Delete after use) Make AI not repeat it self.
/i (Iterations) How many iterations the AI will go through.
/de (Debug) Se whats going on.

The output data will be in Output.txt

Put the input data in Text.txt






types of training

1. Just random words from the input.
2. Better but idk if it is a neural network, maybe kinda nueral network??? (Use this one)


So if you wanna use (2) then you do it like this


run -2

And if you wanna use (1) then you do it like this.

run -1


But now you wanna specify how many iterations the AI will go through. You do that with /i (Numbers). You need to do this for (1 and 2)


run -2 /i (nummbers)


Recomended between 100-2000.

But if you do this you will get something like this:
so it out to figure i'm trying can't but then i =out you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must you, must

It starts to repeating one single line over and over.

So to stop that do this.

This will also slow down the text generation...

run -2 /dau /i (numbers)





Then it will look something like this:


 we , that dr. phil: that. x2 told her kaylie: i care. (damn) and don't gabrielle: no, teenage brain? on a of that neurological impact about the research says what the any idea... you have phil: do * dr. ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? *chuckle* * clap. x2 that's a x4* pewds: * *clap ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? x2 * she's scared. minutes. man: about five funny in to be not going this is joke.
