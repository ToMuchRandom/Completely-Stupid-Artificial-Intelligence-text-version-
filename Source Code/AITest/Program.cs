        // public static string Text = "what is up guys Austin here or Luna so many people have been commenting asking for videos with lean and have you tried it like what's your first time experiences with it and I'm just gonna start this video off by saying when you watch my video this is not a good thing to happen to me I did not like the experience should you go out and try lean fuck no you shouldn't really go and try anything from watching my videos no you shouldn't I'm not trying to sound like your parents but honestly lean fucking kills people it's addicting it's theirs if I there's opiates in it I'm pretty sure I didn't know much about it when I was going into this situation so I don't know exactly what's in it I know it's like promise I promise Isis I you say it I can't fucking pronounce it it's codeine I think it's promise promise eyes I can't fucking say it there's Jolly Ranchers in it and there's sprite and one other thing that I'm missing but um it's really like it's really powerful and it's a fucking shitty thing to do so don't do it so to go into this I was at a party guys one year ago I was at a party a year ago and um it was going everywhere on this party like this kid brought like all of it and this one kid was straight hooked on the shit he was always doing it I used to see him and the fucking streets just drinking and drinking he'd always go outside school and sell it and little sprite bottles and like fucking he's a really dumb kid and he really peer pressure me into this guy's he walked up to me and straight-up was just like yo I got this cup right here five dollars at this party I was at sitting on a couch I was literally in the middle of a bong hit when this kid came over it was like yo five dollars I got she right here five dollars I'm like no I'm like I don't know if I'm ready for that dude I'm like I'm interested in trying it but I really don't want to and he's like dude it just makes you feel good inside just five dollars it's not even harmful it's completely fine and a year ago I didn't know shit about this stuff so I was just like fuck it fine so I got peer pressured into this guy's and he I gave him $5.00 and he literally sat down next to me and watch me drink this whole cup within a period of like ten minutes so you know I down this shit and I remember the minute it was going down I can just feel like this fake as drink going into me and it was so warm I can remember my whole like upper body feeling really warm and after like 30 minutes of drinking and I remember everything got really slowed down everything was just super like if you ever watched like a people try and simulate acid trips and videos and they make it seem like they play the sitar like everything's it really slowed and like it was like that like it sounded like someone was slowly like it was just so like so many like audio hallucinations to me I don't know why I don't even think that's normal to do but um I remember everything was super slowed down I remember when I would talk I just sounded like this and I remember like being super out of it like I wasn't in a party mood I was just like out of it and I thought I honestly thought guys I like had to go to the hospital I was so freaked out and it was such a bad experience for me it sucked so much cock and I just remember like immediately like 30 minutes after I did this I felt really warm overwhelmed I told my friends I had to leave and I literally guys I straight walked out of this door like I was a mile away from my house and on this fucking drug I was like slowly like going to my house and I remember getting home laying in my bed and just trying to sleep and eventually after countless time I finally just fucking fell asleep and I remember waking up just so out of it it sucked so bad guys and um it's just not good I don't like it I think it's bad you shouldn't do it it shouldn't be able to be made like I really I don't know but anyway that's my experiences with it don't fucking do it guys if you have done it you know leave some experiences in the comments you know let the viewers know it's not a good thing but um did enjoy the video leave a like if you did it's a free thing to do and leave a comment I love reading your comments or replying and yeah so it's been almost nothing fail Luna guys you guys take care peace hey what's up guys sawsan here or Luna and I have a pretty crazy story time to guess today one that I've been waiting to tell for a pretty long time now the story takes place about a year ago and I was actually on a trip with my friend in California and we were renting an Airbnb and the trip started off honestly perfect it was such a fun trip the first like two days and then day three happened and that's when things kind of got weird I'm very fucking weird I'm somebody who really likes my videos or me on social media I don't know but they knew that I was in that area I don't know if they saw me like the movie theater the day before or at the mall or something but they knew somehow that I was in that area I don't know how I didn't tweet about it I didn't post it on Instagram didn't put it on any of my social medias like this dude must have been like low-key stalking me or something now you're probably wondering Luna why would you assume that well the two days before that um one day we went to the movie theater and the other day we were at a mall and I'm guessing that's where he must have found out that I was in the area and I don't know what he did from there but on the third day we were mainly just chilling inside but then at about 8:00 p.m. we started getting hungry and we don't really have any food in the house so we decided to go out and grab food and then we went to a grocery store to buy some stuff for the house and when we came back is where shit just got weird cuz when we came back I saw the front door of our house wide open and I was just like what the fuck someone broke in because I locked that door and the only way to unlock it is with a code on the door and I know for a fact that's only something the owner of the house who was renting it to us could do and no one else but us knew that code so sorry I fucked someone must have broken and we didn't really have any other option but to go investigate because we took an uber home and the uber was already pulling away so we couldn't just get back in a car and drive away and like call for help in the car we pretty much had the only option to go check it out I mean I obviously could have sat outside and called for help which in that case scenario that is the best thing to do you know if you're ever in a situation like that obviously stay away from the house stay outside call for help but me and my friend were like too curious and just too angry to like not figure out what was going on so me my friend stormed in that house and we started checking all the rooms and we couldn't find anything but for some reason the dude that came in the house just like rearranged everything we went in the house and like my suitcase was open and I'm like a completely different side of the room but like not went through it all and then like my laptop was moved and then like my backpack that was in the closet was out of the closet and by my dresser instead but like nothing seemed to be touched or stolen which was the weirdest part and I was like what the fuck like what did someone just come in and just mess up the rooms just to like make us clean them like I'm so confused I was trying to think that like the owner came through and was looking for something so being confused as fuck I go over to my friend's room and I'm like yo do any of your stuff get stolen he's like no things just got moved around I'm like yeah me too and then me and him went in the living room together and we noticed how they got in there was a back door and the lock was broken from the day we got there but it was just really hard to open in general so that's probably why the guy didn't put a new lock on it anyway but yeah you could open it if you put a lot of force on it and there was no lock so pretty much that was how the dude got in and that's pretty much what he must have done because when I went to that door to like check it out I saw someone in our backyard and I immediately thought to myself like whole fuck like I really hope this dude doesn't beat the SH out I mean you have a weapon and he turns around he looks at me and like he just looked so like confused and I was like hey and he just like kept staring at me didn't say a word I was like can you talk and say anything and my friend came over he's like yo what the fuck you doing in our backyard and the guy just wasn't saying anything he just kept staring at us with like that confused look on his face so that I asked him I was like are you alone he just nodded his head so at this point I had two things going through my mind I was even thinking this guy's a really good actor and he's pretending to like just not be able to talk and you know like acting confused or he could be legitimately confused and he might even have some sort of disability or something I was really wanting to believe that like this guy wasn't just some crazy dude that broke into our house to try and steal stuff and from the way he was acting I kind of believed that there could be something more to the situation with him so I approached the guy a little bit more kind of slowly and I asked for his name and said his name was Cameron I was like okay what's up Cameron um do you have a parent I can call about this he's like here and he gave me a number and I was like okay whose number is this he was my dad's I'll say okay how old are you he's like 17 and I was okay why were you in our house and you just wouldn't say anything and I was like to do steal anything and he nodded no I was like okay I'm gonna call your dad so I called his dad and I was like hey is this Cameron's father he's like yeah like my name's Austin I don't really know the situation with him or if this is him you know like committing a crime intentionally but he broke into my rental house well I'm on vacation here and I told Mirai was I was like and he's just in my backyard right now like looking super confused and I can't really tell what's going on can you come help me out he's like shit I'm so sorry I'm so sorry and he goes on to explain that his son doesn't really pick up on what's right and wrong sometimes and is confused and to basically just be careful with him until he gets there and stuff like that and the way he was explaining it I was like okay like this isn't just some like you know act this dude's putting on like this kid actually is confused and it's not some act he's putting on because he was trying to hide the fact that he did something wrong so I ended up just telling his dad our address and he came over and we started talking as a group and he kept apologizing to me and you know I wasn't really that upset because none of my self was stolen I was just more confused and he started talking to his son more and his son started to open up a little bit more because his dad was there and he was more comfortable I'm guessing um and he told his dad he goes I just wanted to meet Austin and that's when my mind was blown I was like wait what because I didn't tell him my name so he like knew my name I was like what do you mean and he's like I watched you and I was like oh oh well thanks man you didn't have to do that but thank you and his dad was like what do you mean you want to meet him and I explained to his dad I'm like I make youtube videos and he must know about them and he's like oh really I was like yeah he's like oh that's awesome you have to give me your channel link and I the back of my head I was thinking like you probably don't want my channel link it's probably not that good for older adults but that's just where I assumed maybe do maybe I do have some older fans I don't know but I did give him my channel link in the end but his dad just kept apologizing to me and was so so like sorry about it and I did believe him and in the end I didn't want to go any further than calling his dad and getting him to I deal with the situation and nothing was stolen his dad made him empty his pockets before they left didn't have anything of mine and his dad gave me his cellphone number again and his mom's cell phone number again just in case but nothing happened after that and in the end everyone was okay and that was pretty much the end he didn't steal anything from me deep down a good kid just some confusion I guess I still don't fully understand to this day but yeah pretty crazy my opinion definitely scared the shit out of me at first glance like when I first saw someone standing in my backyard I was like okay I'm a little bit terrified but uh hey guys that's pretty much the end of the story time I do want to take this last part of the video to say I'm doing a 2 million subscriber Q&A tomorrow so if you want to ask a question for that Q&A just tweet me a question using hashtag you asked Luna and yeah guys that's pretty much it I hope you enjoyed this video leave a like on the video if you guys enjoyed it see you guys out later peace hey what's up guys it's Austin here or Luna some today's stories I'm telling you guys another high school story and in a way it kind of connects to my last story time so if you haven't seen my storytime from yesterday I'll put it top link in the description go watch that first and you understand this one a little bit better I kind of used that person's tactic for my own benefit in a way so the story starts off as a very normal day I was actually in my original high school at this point again I got sent back to my normal school I wasn't no longer in like the program for the the bad kids whatever so I was in a way bigger area stuff like that more people but anybody this day started off pretty normally I got up took a shower got dressed got ready all that stuff got on the bus went to school I get to school and then I ate breakfast and I went to the first two classes of the day and on the third class third period I actually forgot a book I needed so I had to ask the teacher for permission to go back to my locker so I did and I was the only one in the halls because of rooms in class and I turned the corner to go to my locker and I like turn and I can see someone at my locker someone I know now I wouldn't call this person a friend of mine but I was kind of an acquaintance with him and I've heard things about him before sounds like fuck what is he doing and I can just see him like on one knee just looking through my locker pulling stuff out like looking through my bag and thank fuck I was a smart dude and I didn't keep anything of value in my locker like besides schoolbooks and stuff that was the only thing that was ever in there and my backpack too I would always carry like my phone and valuable stuff on me because I didn't trust people and those lockers were so easy to break into and I see him just on one knee going through my locker and I thought to myself I'm like okay I have a few options option one I go up to him and confront him and get him to stop robbing my locker trying to steal from me and it could result in a fight option two I go up to the main office and snitch on him or option 3 revenge very very clever revenge not anything too bad they get me in trouble but something kind of funny and then it clicked in my head I'm like wait literally just a few months ago someone pranks me about putting my ringtone on his porn and then calling my phone in class and getting it to play really loud to everybody and I got laughed at a bunch I'm just going to do that too sky but on a much larger scale so you're probably wondering Luna how would you do that on a larger scale just keep listening so I kept watching this guy try and rob my locker and find stuff to steal and in the back of my head I knew I'm like he's not gonna find anything I have everything valuable in my pockets like my phone my wallet stuff like that so I wasn't worried he was gonna find anything but schoolbooks and like folders so unless he wants to steal my homework that was probably a D at most like he's not gonna be able to find anything so I turned around and I went back to my classroom you're probably wondering why the fuck would you let him just keep going through your locker well I knew that there was nothing in there there was nothing you could take that I would even care about him taking and like that would have any value to him and to I had a plan and I had to really really think about it so I went back to my class without my book which was kind of annoying because the teacher was mad at me but I went back to class got through that class and then I got through the rest of my day the whole school day and I went home and I had to go home so I can acquire what I needed for this plan so I went home played some xbox one about my day normally after school then I had dinner and then I laid down and start watching some TV and I fell asleep and the next morning I woke up earlier than I usually do and I went over to my desk grab my Bluetooth speaker fully charged put it in my backpack then I took a shower and got dressed and I was all ready for school now you can probably already see where this is going so I went to school got the first period open my notebook and I took a sharpie and I drew the word thief I grabbed some scotch tape and I put tape on the back of it and I went out to the hallway after first period and just watched that dude I found him in the hallway and I followed him from very far behind and I watched him go to his locker and I got where his locker was I got the exact number and then I waited for the bell to ring and for everyone to go to class so as soon as everyone went to class I went over to his locker gave it a really hard kick and pulled up on it and it opened because all of our lockers were really easy to do that too so after getting his locker Open I taped the paper that said the thief on it right to the locker door so when he to open it that'd be the first thing he saw and I took my speaker turned it on put it on full volume and Bluetooth connected my phone to it and put it on the top shelf of his locker very far back to so it'd be hard for him to reach immediately like he could reach it but not too quick and that's what I did so then I shut the locker once in my class right across the hallway and went about my class and then right after the bell rang to go back in the hallway I was like the first person out there just waiting because I was so excited to see what was about to happen and I see him go to his locker and right as he's about to open it I had the video pre-loaded and everything I searched up the loudest orgasm ever and clicked play and I swear like the minute he opened his locker the whole fucking hallway heard that shit and everyone stared at him and you seemed immediately reached into his locker and shut the speaker off he was like what the fuck and the whole fucking hallway of people just started laughing so hard including me I was just so happy I was laughing so fucking hard and then he slammed his locker really hard probably because he didn't want anyone to see the big paper that said thief on it and he just looked right at me right after he slammed his locker and he got like really red in the face and I thought he was about to like run at me and tackle me and start trying to fight or something but he just turned around and just walked away as quick as he could so I'm guessing his face being red was either from embarrassment or anger or a little bit of both from what just happened so after that pretty much that's all anybody was talking about for the rest of the day and he never mess with me again that was literally the end of it and yeah that's pretty much the story like more the story is don't steal out of my locker sorry correction don't attempt to steal out of my locker he wasn't successful now if you ever find yourself in a situation like this just tell someone because like getting up with the speaker and playing porn as funny as it was he could actually stole some shit of mine thankfully I was smart I didn't have anything he could steal but yeah but I guess at the end of the story time if you enjoyed this or find it funny please leave a like on the video I would really appreciate it leave your guys's stories and the comments down below subscribe if you're new I see you later peace hey it's good guys it's Austin here or Luna so today's story of time takes place about two years back at a concert I love concerts personally I'm a big fan of going to shows it's really fun but sometimes you just run into people there that are either drunk fucked up on something or they're just angry I don't really people pick concerts and events to just lash out and be fucking stupid sometimes and today's storytime is about one of those times so let's get into this if you like this leave a like let's start this so two years back at one of my friends houses and we were getting ready to go to a concert that night and it wasn't anything that crazy it wasn't like a famous famous artist or anything it's just a few local bands and it was outside and it's gonna be fun so we go to this festival thing we get there having fun at first started off great then a few hours later night time rolled around and shit changed people got a little bit more you know drunk angry I don't know like the people there just were acting different and someone was walking by my friend and bumped into him it wasn't my friend's fault my friend as wasn't paying attention he bumps into my friend and he was with a group of people and he turns around he goes watch we were fucking going it's my friend and my friend was like man I wasn't even moving I was just watching the show and the guy goes I don't give a fuck watch where you're going and his friends start to kind of like circle around him and like back him up and it was like three of his friends with him so it was for them and then me and two people so it was three of us and I'm just like what the fuck like I don't want to get into a fight right now like these dudes just fuck off and my friends like well I don't want to say man I was looking at the show like I wasn't trying to bump in you just just go enjoy the show and the dude goes don't tell me what to do he turns around he starts walking away and my friend turns around he's like geez what the fuck's that problem and I see I know I see them coming back they're coming back to talk to us and they come up to us and the guy that bump into my friend says my friend you talking shit right when I start walking away you turn around you start talking shit and my friends like dude what is your problem and before he could even reply he throws a punch of my friend hits him and I was like oh fuck like this okay well now it's just a fight like okay so they start fighting my friend and this guy are going at it just fucking duking it out and we're all watching like literally his friends and my friends are watching and we're just like what the fuck and then one of them jumps in against my friend so it's a 2v1 so then my other friend jumps in with them and it becomes like a shit pretty much like a two V two of my friends versus random dudes at a concert so then the rest of his friends jump in and start ganging up on my friends and pretty much I was like you know what fuck this I'm done watching I jumped in I start punching this dude in the head who was on top of my friend trying to get him off and I don't know what happened but next thing I knew I was waking up somewhere I didn't know where I was I woke up to two people looking over me completely separated from my friends I know where they were and then I remembered what happened I was like oh fuck I'm waking up in a paramedics tent right now at the concert I was like what's going on where are my friends and the girls like you're okay like you're safe you're alright you just got knocked out and I was like where are my friends and she's like they're here - they're just in the other tent I was like okay good and I started talking to her I told everything that happened pretty much and apparently according to one of the witnesses that's how the fight go down when I jumped on top of one of the people one of their friends kicked me in the fucking face so hard that I went down and just completely passed out and I was like damn and I believed it cuz I could feel it on the side of my face like my my teeth and like the whole side of my face was sore and it hurt and I had a headache I could taste blood I was like oh fuck I felt so defeated in this moment I was like damn like I got my ass beat like all I wanted to do was help my friend no I don't want this shit to happen but anyway I asked her I was like did they keep punching me after I was knocked out and she goes no according to the lady that witnessed the fight she said you just got knocked out and then left there to lay I was like where is this lady like can I talk to her about it and she's like yeah she's in the other tent talking to the other paramedics with your friends and stuff telling them what's going on and then she'll be back here I was like okay cool and I started talking to her more and I was just asking her like I'm gonna be able to leave today like go to the hospital and she goes no I don't think so like if you feel like you don't have to go and you feel okay you look pretty stable to us you just didn't need a lot of icing and resting and maybe some over-the-counter pain medicine I was like alright good and she's like alright you wanna go see your friends I was like yeah that'd be great and I was so surprised I thought she was gonna bring like a police officer or a security guard because like apparently they were the ones that broke it up the security so I thought wasn't get in trouble but I went over to the tent there was a security guard in there but he didn't say anything to me and I met up with my friends one of my friends look really fucked up his nose was bleeding and some cuts he looked a lot worse than I did but he was okay too for the most part like none of my friends were seriously seriously injured so after we talked to the paramedics for a little bit they basically said we were free to go and then I asked one of security guards I was like hey like are we good to come back for any future events or like you know like stay for the shows or anything and he's like yeah we know you didn't start it like it's not your guy's fault you were just defending yourselves he hit you first and he pointed to my friend because my friend was when we got hit first and he's like yeah you guys are welcome back anytime those other boys though that fought with you they are banned from all future events and I was like oh awesome so in my head I'm thinking like you know we kind of took an out because well I at least did I got fucking knocked out and my friend looked pretty rough I don't know what the other people looked like to be honest but I kind of took a nail but at the same time we contacted W cuz like they got banned and we didn't get in trouble because you know we were just defending ourselves so be hey guys more the story is like I don't know just fucking stay clear of people like that if someone's being drunk and annoying or just annoying in general and trying to start a fight and there's being violent just walk the fuck away from them like they can just go fuck themselves but yeah guys that's pretty much end of the story time if you like the story time and find entertaining please leave a like on the video I would really appreciate it leave your guys's

regardless anyway on to the video now today's storytime is another school story okay so this takes place back in high school you know young Luna doing what he did you know playing video games here on a school everyday being really bored and tired you know kind of a normal school routine this was in 9th grade okay so around this time I was actually in this like school that wasn't my main high school I was kind of in like a secondary school because I wasn't showing up a lot on time I was being late everyday so they put me in this program to kind of like get me back on track because I was so behind and I needed extra help so pretty much everybody there was either there to get extra help with learning or because they were a really bad kid and they had to be placed in smaller classrooms because they were getting in too much trouble beating bigger classrooms being distracted and I was kind of there for a little bit of both and we have this really cool period every day that was like almost an hour long and we just had to sit in the cafeteria and just talk to each other it was really awesome it was straight-up break period and we didn't have that in my normal high school like we had study hall which was kind of the same thing but in study hall they sometimes would kind of force us to do homework and in this free period we had at this other school they wouldn't really force us to do anything it was pretty much just a break so anyway it was really cool I would just sit there talk to my friends in the cafeteria whatever my one friend would always hang out with his girlfriend and they would just kind of like sit there and make out and the teachers never gave a fuck but one day I'm sitting there at school in free period talking with some friends at the lunch table just you know hanging out talking to some friends and my one friend is with his girlfriend on the complete other side of the cafeteria sitting at his lunch table with her and they're making out like always and I don't know what the fuck happened like what escalated so quickly but I guess he just couldn't wait to go home him and his girlfriend start getting like touchy and shit and next thing I know I look over there and I can see her like bent over on his lap like his back turned to everybody he was in the corner he was at a corner table so his back was turned everybody so was hers and she was like bent over in his lap and he had his hoodie over her back and I was like oh my fucking god like guys guys I tell everyone like look he's fucking getting head look he's getting a head over there and they're all starting to fucking laugh like pointing at him and sure enough everyone soon enough in the cafeteria looks over and can see him getting fucking head from his girlfriend just getting a goddamn blowjob everyone's laughing and he knows that's the best part he would turn around every few seconds to make sure like a teacher wouldn't come or something and he would turn around and see everyone laughing and then go back to his business and as long as it wasn't a teacher he didn't care so I'm fucking laugh my ass off at this and within five minutes it gets ruined his fun was over because the teacher caught him and she starts yelling she's like what are you doing like what is this this is not what your break period is for like I can't even believe this like go over to the office right now get to the main office and yeah they stormed out of there walked through the main office and class was dismissed the free period was dismissed it got cut 15 minutes short which fucking sucked and I was like oh that's stupid and I go on with the rest of my day right I thought that was the end of it well no because the next day comes along right and I go into school and I sit down and my teacher starts having a talk with us she's like listen guys you're free period that you get every day it's done your friend ruined it for all of you we can't trust you guys anymore it's it's over with and I was like fuck it's a sad day it's a sad day my selfish mother fucking friend had to get his dick sucked under a cafeteria table and now we can't fucking have this nice free period anymore you know play pool on our phones or do whatever the fuck I don't know draw penises on notebooks whatever but yeah it was a sad fucking day pretty much my friend he did get suspended too by the way I forgot to mention that he definitely got suspended I didn't see him at school for a few days after that but pretty much one of the only dope things about this place was ruined for me because my selfish friend had to get his dick sucked under the table but yeah after that the rest of my days at that school were even more boring because I didn't have a free period every day to just do whatever I wanted because my friend ruined it and then eventually I ended up going back to my normal school and yeah just kind of sucked but I thought it was a funny story and whenever I tell that to somebody they laugh so hopefully you guys laugh too if you guys enjoyed this story please leave a like on the video leave your stories in the comments down below subscribe if you're new I'll see you guys all

the Internet in general is so fucking cool and you guys know that I love to use it considering I'm on YouTube every day and like all sorts of stuff like that and you know I'm a pretty fucking big nerd but it's fun to use and so the other day I thought hey let's make a reddit account okay you guys know what Retta is I'm sure a lot of you do website really cool website actually and a bunch of my friends use it seriously everyone I know online everyone I know in real life fucking loves reddit so I'm like alright I'm gonna make it account finally I want to see what this website tell about I don't go on it often and I make an account okay and I seriously I love like exploring new things so I thought this was gonna be really cool and I make an account okay and reddit can be like the coolest place on earth and the most fucked up place on earth and I didn't know that until the other day so I text one of my friends on skype I hit him up and I was like dude I made a reddit account can you link me some of your favorite subreddits and he links me like a fuck ton of these like redirect links like they weren't reddit links they were like the bit ly links whatever they're called and I'm like what the fuck are these I told them like I'm not clicking at any of these egos dude you really think I'm gonna do something wrong like come on just trust me something all right so I clicked the first link and it redirects me to this weird fucking subreddit can you remember the name I know it started with ruh like are you Eeyore something and it fucking literally is a subreddit filled with porn like straight-up like porn cartoon porn that's the best part and I'm literally seeing my favorite childhood shows remastered into this like HD drawn animated porn and I was like okay fuck you so I close out of this and I'm like dude I used to watch Spongebob as a kid and I don't need to see him get penetrated by Sandy so that was fucking horrible okay so that just that just really iced the cake for me right there so I completely blocked all the messages from him and you know completely ignored them all and when to actually go look deeper into this website and I found some really cool stuff and then I ended up going from reddit to Twitter and then from like Twitter to all these weird videos and by the end of the night I was on the most fucked-up side of the internet I've ever seen in my life so that was really fun and I don't know it just got me thinking like once a month every month I'll just get super bored and I'll be like huh there's nothing to do I already made a video I already tweeted I'm don't go back on Twitter so I just start watching these videos and that like I go through these chains of videos and by the end of the night I'm watching the most fucked up shit I've ever seen in my life and for example last night I don't even know what I did to get to this video but I was just clicking all these related videos and I ended up landing on this one in particular that really was fucked up of these dudes on like a New York City sidewalk and they're like talking to this homeless guy and it looked really cool actually like they're being really nice to him they like a radio show going on or something and he offers them cake like he pulls out this fucking cake and he's like hey you guys want some and the guy goes oh yeah put it on the ground he puts it on the ground this fucking dude jumps on his fucking cake I was like okay I'm getting off the internet right there I was logged off and fucking went upstairs and fell asleep because it was like 5:00 in the morning at that point and it just made me think like fuck mad like some of these videos I know it's the internet like it's inevitable you can't you can't clean that side up but I'm just that type of person we're all see something super fucked up and it sticks in my head for weeks and a weeks on end and it never leaves until I distract myself with some other video that gets stuck in my head and it's horrible because I'm that type of person where I'll see something and it sticks in my head but it's never anything good or helpful like for example my teacher will be like all right we got a test tomorrow study this tonight I could study it for 10 fucking hours and forget everything the next morning but if I see a video of a homeless dudes cake getting crushed it sticks in my head word for word for the entire fucking night and then the next day I can remember the whole thing without even watching it and it just sucks because it stays in my mind for so long that it makes me want to go out to New York City find this dude and buy him a lifetime supply of cakes but I can't because I am not able to do that and I wish I could but yeah I just kind of want to make a video about the shit I see on the internet because it goes from like really really happy to really really fucked-up to really really disgusting real fast for me because late at night I just look so far into things and I end up on those deep deep sides of the internet but I kinda want to make a video about it so if you like this video click the like button and yeah I'll see you guys all later avoid all fucked up photos on the internet especially the ones of Sandy and SpongeBob fucking and I'll see you guys tomorrow peace hey what's up guys it's Austin here so the whole last week I've been telling a lot of like serious story times and like more crazy story times this one's just a funny one okay the story time takes place back in my sophomore year of high school okay I was hanging out in class with a friend working on a project of ours and it was when vaping was getting popular now vaping it's kind of like a fucking religion to some people it's a little bit creepy how serious some people take it I literally watch my friend who's never had nicotine in his life like never smoked a cigarette and none of that he hid a vape and he liked it so he got one and then he became addicted to nicotine through vaping which was supposed to help people quit and now he like hits his jewel like it's fucking oxygen like he sucks at like a dick every day so yeah that's it's kind of how people from my town are with vaping but anyway back to the story I got a little sidetracked me and my friend are in class and we had this other friend does calm Josh Josh fucking love to vape he was like actually severely addicted to that shit because he would go under his shirt in class he was here under his fucking shirt she was hitting his vape and he would hide it and he like he got the zero the fucking vape because if he blew any out he'd get caught and it was so fucking funny he looked like a legit junkie in class he'd be in his shirt hiding taking quick vape it's so that he could have his fix sure enough that's exactly what he was doing on this day like straight up he was in class hiding in his shirt taking quick vape hits and his partner didn't come in on this day so he was completely alone he's not working on his project so he's just hiding in a shirt a ticking vape it's and all of a sudden I hear the teacher go Josh are you okay everyone looks because everyone knew what he was doing he was hiding in his shirt to take vape hits but she thought he was sad or something and was like hiding in his shirt to cry and when she said his name he quickly like came out of his shirt like a fucking turtle out of the shell and he looked at her he's not his head yes he wouldn't say anything because he had a full mouth of fucking vape and she goes Josh are you okay she says it again and he just nods again and she goes why aren't you talking like just answer yes or no are you okay he just goes I'm fine and the Middle East says hit just a fucking cloud comes out this little cloud of fucking you babe smoke and she goes groan the hallway right now I'll be out and sure enough Josh marches into the hallway and waits for and she went out there with them and like ten minutes later she comes back in holding his vape and he's like please give it back come on please and he's following you're begging for the vape and she goes Josh you can have it back after school you can't have this in school and he's just like come on man please like please that's my property that's mine give me it back and she goes yeah well it's not allowed in school you can get it after school he just looks at her and he starts tearing up and I'm like there's no way this dude's about to start crying over a vape no way and sure enough a tear goes on his face I don't know whether to like play the sad violin or just like feel bad for this dude but he was really shedding a tear over his lost friend his lost hero the vape and he fucking walks back to his seat and sits down with his arms crossed like an angry toddler and he literally just goes back in his shirt at this time it was because he was vaping it was cuz he was actually like embarrassed and tearing up over the vape and you probably think about it's a story in there like he cried over a vape like that's probably as good as it's gonna get right oh no no not at all because ten minutes later Josh stands up he decides to try again he goes over to her desk and he goes listen miss can I please have my vape back like I promise I won't hit it anymore and she goes no Josh you can have it after school because you don't want your a bitch in the whole class is like oh shit and she goes really really Josh that's what you're gonna say to me and everyone starts dying laughing because he's getting so angry over the vape and he goes yeah yeah honestly you're a bitch you're taking people's property their personal property and you won't give it back til after school like that's my e-cig and I deserve that and she goes it's not allowed in school now please go to the main office he goes I'll go to the main office when I get my vape back and she goes you're not getting your little vape back go upstairs and he goes no not until you give me my vape back and she goes whatever I was gonna call security and they're gonna ask her what you up there and he goes see if I give a fuck he goes you know what since you want to take personal property of people this is mine now and he reaches over across her desk and steals her stapler he fucking steals the teachers stapler but probably doesn't even belong to her it's probably the schools and she's like Josh give me my stapler back and he goes no not tell you my vape and she Josh you are not proving a point by stealing my stapler right now and he goes oh yeah I'm not proving a point huh he goes well here's your fucking point and he does a 360 and throws it at the fucking SMART Board full force and cracks it like completely broke the smart board with the stapler cuz he threw it full force at it and broke the screen and he just runs out of the room and of course she called security immediately and they had to go find him and I don't really know what happened after this I don't know he forgot his fate back I'm guessing his parents probably picked it up after school or he did or he had to you know give it up and sell it to pay for the fucking broken SMART Board I don't know but yeah dude he stole her stapler I just couldn't get over that he goes this is mine now he takes the fucking stapler as if that proves anything but I don't know maybe that stapler was fucking handed down from generations like it was like some fucking legendary stapler that she had a lot of sentimental value with yeah guys I didn't see Josh in class for two days after that so I'm guessing you got suspended either in school or out of school and that's pretty much the story of the vape legend Josh it's a very very wise tale I'm pretty sure people will read their children this for a bedtime story one day because it's that fucking special like who doesn't want to hear the legend of Josh the vape legend like come on man yeah guys if you found this story funny please leave a like on the video if you don't leave a like then I'm gonna come to your house and steal your staplers I'm not actually gonna do that I'm just kidding oh yeah guys if you liked the video leave a like on the video leave your stories in the comments down below subscribe if you're new and I see you guys all later peace hey what's here guys it's Austin here or Luna so I'm pretty sure everyone watching this video is either heard about fortnight or has played it or is playing here right now it's like one of the biggest games in the fucking world right now and it probably will go down as one of the biggest games in the world it's a fucking crazy ass game I play it myself I'm not very good at it okay so if you expect me to get some crazy four and I can't play it for you don't expect that anytime soon I'm still learning but everyone's pretty much played it right myself included today's story time is actually about fortnight okay the story takes place about a month and a half ago it was very when I started getting seriously into the game and playing it a lot I was facetiming an IRL friend of mine we were just literally sit on FaceTime and play a fortnight pretty much all night we just do oh and he has a girlfriend well he had a girlfriend and they seemed to have like a pretty good relationship I've met her before we've all hung out before together and she seemed to like him he liked her whatever well when fortnight started getting popular he started playing that game hardcore like he's fucking insane at the game like I actually believe if he kept it up he could actually be a pro like no joke but anyway it was a normal night for me okay a month and a half ago I'm sitting in my room it's late his fucking night I'm just on FaceTime with my friend playing duo's on for night and things are going fucking great we're just on FaceTime playing for a night talking there was like 15 people left alive in our game so I really thought we had a chance of winning and you know we just kept playing everything we're still going good and then we get to like the last eight people in the game right so now I really think we have a good chance of winning and all of a sudden I hear his door open on FaceTime and I hear giggling and it's his girlfriend and I don't say anything right because I didn't think anything of it I just thought his girlfriend walked in t hey what's up guys it's Austin here or Luna so I'm back today with part two - yesterday's story time so where I left off was the day after the barbecue and if you don't know what story time I'm talking about and you don't know what part - this is even for I'll put a link to the video right here on the screen this is yesterday's story time and this is part 1 - the story I'm telling right now and the story I'm telling right now is part two okay back on track so I was added to a group chat with a bunch of people from that barbecue and that party or whatever and they all wanted revenge and I was like okay this is either a really good idea a really bad idea because either someone's gonna get fucking hurt or something's gonna be really funny and not be that bad and we won't come trouble but I was kind of thinking we're gonna get in a lot of trouble because it's fucked up revenge because the student us or its to be more of a prank that just kind of fucks his whole day up and won't seriously harm him and it kind of ended up being that second one so somebody in the group chat suggests that we all like squat up in different cars like four in each car go to the store buy a bunch of like eggs and toilet paper and just tons of shit and just go pull the ultimate prank ever so that's what we did we went to the store the next day we got over 10 cartons of eggs and over 20 rolls of toilet paper and some of that silly string stuff and we bought three confetti blasters which basically looks like an extra-long Pringle can and you turn each end of the bottom a certain way and it just blasts fuck tons of confetti all over the place and it's pretty harmless but it just makes a mess so after we bought all this shit we drive over to his house and it's like 12:00 midnight all the lights are off it looks like everyone's asleep and we just get to fucking work like I probably threw seven eggs and like two rolls of toilet paper and this girl I knew ran up to the door and put a letter on it like taped a letter to it and I had no idea what it s";

( ?° ?? ?°) surely, she can't be that bad. what can she do that would be such a big deal? cj (father): five months after kaylie and i had separated, gabriel had come home and she dropped a big bomb. she was eleven years old at the time. kaylie: i explained to my daughter i was a professional dominatrix. (......) s'cuse me? *chuckles* could you say that again?? cj: she was 11 years old at the time. kaylie: i explained to my daughter, that i was a professional dominatrix. pewds: she's a domi- what? the ones that like to... wear the thing...? and spank the thing?? 50 shades of things???? okay, that seems like an appropriate thing to tell your... eleven year old daughter. i don't see why not. cj: she's been drinking alcohol. she and gabriel were smoking pot together. my daughter has also been sexually active. kaylie: sex is a natural thing. we eat, we use the bathroom, we shower, and we have sex! it's not a big deal. dr. phil: your wife has become a dominatrix, and you send your daughter to live with her! dr. phil: i get here this morning, and, they're telling me, that over the weekend, three security guards are standing outside your hotel door! you had been very loud, smoking marijuana, disturbing other guests, and threw a... used, feminine product- pewds: what? feminine product? what is he referring to? (a tampon) dr. phil: so, when you arrive at the main- pewds: i love these reactions that they added in. dr. phil: so, when you arrive- *weird pewdiepie gasping noises* do they just tell people in the audience to make silly faces? i mean surely that's not that shocking, i don't think a lot of people that made me-- a lot of things that made me go- except when i really yawn. *laughs* up top, everybody! smash like on this video if you yawn. dr. phil: in the west building, the next afternoon, with your daughter, and apologized and admit that you and gabrielle just got high last night. and then, braless, you pull out your breast in front of the staff in the lobby- pewdiepie: what?? kaylie: yeah... dr phil: -and explain: i sometimes get naked when i get irritated. pewdiepie: what!!??? kaylie: yeah... pewdiepie: *quoting woman* i sometimes get naked when i'm irritated. as you do. x2 *laughs* sometimes i take a poop when i'm tired dr phil: you smoke marijuana with her? kaylie: yeah, we smoke before we meditate. come, uh... come take a look! come, uh... come take a look! dr phill: well, okay, i will. oh, she's here. dr phill: well, okay. i will. oh, she's here. pewdiepie: so, let's hear, from gabrielle, what this relationship is like. gabrielle: my dad really does want me to act like some typical white girl. it's just not me... *pewdiepie laughs* *imitating gabrielle* my dad just wants me to be a typical white girl~. *lifts shirt* it's just not me. *laughs* gabrielle: i started having sex about a year ago. i feel like i'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, just because i have all the- pewds: oh lookadit!! i feel like i'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, just because i have all the- i feel like i'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship, just because i have all- pewdiepie: it's so funny, they're always so delusional. all kids are stupid, okay.... there's nothing wrong with it. it's just when they're especially stupid, that it becomes funny. gabrielle: i love my mom's work. i so respect my mom's work. and i so treasure my mom's work, only because of the way her eyes light up when she talks to me about it. pewdiepie: wait... she likes that her mom is a dominatrix, because her eyes lit up when she talks about it? hey kid! let me tell you about my job... i spank people! okay? so great, sharing your passions with your daughter. ?? ?? ??? i feel bad for the daughter, i really do. like, she deserves better parents. cj: gabrielle is a teenager, she's a young lady. this is beyond inappropriate. it's crazy! kaylie: some people might say that i'm a prostitute! cj said that i'm a self-made whore. i love what i do, and i don't care what anybody thinks... much less cj. pewdiepie: well you just reiterated what he said, so therefore, you do care. aha- point, proven, wrong. ha- owned libtard. kaylie: i'd like to address your understanding of my profession. dr. phil: okay... kaylie: so, while what i do is sexual in nature, it's not sexual in... work. it's about the idea of that. and it's a very deep subject so it's probably... another topic but- pewds: it's a very deep topic, the topic of dominatrix. you wouldn't possibly understand dr. phil. maybe we could come back later and we could discuss this. you're here for your daughter, okay? just get that right. no one cares. kaylie: it's about... um... fantasy. does that make sense? dr. phill: i'll take your word for it. *audience laughs* pewdiepie: come on, doctor. you know- you know exactly- *snickers* i know what goes on in the dr. phil house. kaylie: my daughter understands what it is- and it's, uh- it's important. pewds: why? what's important about it? why is it important for your daughter to know about it? it's so weird! dr. phil: you have your daughter right now and where do you live? kaylie: we don't really live anywhere, we've been waiting for my settlement from cj to get our new place, and so now, we've just been with different friends. pewds: this is what happens when you marry a thot. okay, a bad thot. it like a bad, bad (incoherent). you never truly recovered from them. dr. phil: you smoked marijuana with her. kaylie: i do now yeah, we smoke before we meditate- when we meditate together. pewds: so the mom explains why she lets her smoke weed, and it's basically because at least then she'll know that it's nothing bad, in the weed. besides, you know, like if you buy it on the street you can sometimes-- i don't know anything about this okay! so just- i don't know. that's her philosophy at least. dr. phil: now she's 14! kaylie: i agree, and- *sigh* pewds: i agree! she is 14. i agree. i guess- i suppose we can agree that she is 14 years old. this whole weed issue however- kaylie: i tried to find a way to talk to her a way she'd hear me, and try to get on board with me, because... if i tell- even if i tell her, listen i don't think- i don't want a video of that- i don't want you posting that. i don't want- well she'll do it behind my back. x2 so- dr. phil: but you're smoking dope with your daughter at a concert! kaylie: i wasn't smoking that. dr. phil: she- you're with your daughter smoking dope at a concert kaylie: yeah she was- kaylie: -smoking and we were at the concert. yeah. pewds: *pfft* so her excuses that she'll just do it anyway. she's out of control. i can't control her. but you're doing it right next to her! the mom's response, *imitating the mom* uh, well, i wasn't doing it. it was my daughter who was smoking, not me! i would never! gabriele: i feel my mom and i are like twins. we're so much alike! we're identical, we have the same thoughts! pewds: 'cause you both are. ha ha! get it? did i just call a 14 year old a thot? i didn't- that joke came out wrong, okay? it worked for a half a second. okay, i'll take it. gabriel: i feel like i'm completely mature enough to be in a sexual relationship- just because i have all this knowledge and understanding. pewds: i just have so much knowledge and understanding at the age of 14. *mocking gabriel* my mind- i am very smart. my mind, very big. a booga rooga doo my mom teach me very important lessons about life. *intimidating kaylie* hey kid, you want to hear more about th-the spanking? dr. phil: how do you describe a polyamorous relationship? *sigh* gabriele: a relationship where, two people love each other- but have sexual relations with other people. dr. phil: okay, pewds: wait, isn't that an open relationship? poly is when you love more than one person right? *reading* 'ability or capacity to love more than one person at a time- you're talking about an open relatio- dr. phil: so, you're in a polyamorous relationship because... you say, how can one person give you everything gabriel: yeah. dr. phil: you're 14, which- does that seem... to you... young to be sexually active in a relationship?

        //  public static string Text = "yo what's up guys it's austin here or luna so in today's story time i'm telling you guys about how i probably had one of the worst friends in the world to say the least like i've had friends steal from me and you know like fucked me over but like this was like a whole new level of stealing slash fucking me over so this story takes place about a year back i was hanging out at my house with some friends and my one friend goes yo austin can i invite one of my friends over like he's really cool like trust me he's not sketchy sounds alright well what's his name and he's like justin now his name's not actually justin but for the sake of the video let's just say his name is justin he's like justin and i was like okay like how old is he he's our age i'm like is he cool you sure he's like yeah like he's really cool he's actually a fan of you alright whatever i'm so i let this dude come over my house he comes in i introduced myself introduces himself we talked for a little bit and we all just kind of go back to just talking as a group i mean all my friends and him and i'm gonna call him my friend and like an hour or two goes by and he decides he has to leave he said yeah i gotta go ah sorry man so justin left and we were just back to our original group of friends and he drove home and that was it at least i thought thought that was it thought that was the end of justin lee i wouldn't see him anymore but the next day i wake up and i realized something my twitter got fucking deactivated and i was like what the fuck like completely deactivated i was like what and then like i went on instagram and i couldn't sign in an instagram i was like yo what the fuck all my shits getting hacked so i immediately hop on youtube i know to my account settings and i lock out any devices that are on there currently changed the password all that stuff completely secure my youtube account because that's like my most important social media account obviously so luckily they didn't get to that yet the hackers at least i thought they were hackers and then i went downstairs and i grabbed my password book because i have a book full of passwords in my basement where i was hanging out with my friends on this bookshelf and i go to grab it and it's fucking missing someone stole my book of passwords so i started texting all my friends my yo did any of you grab a notebook yesterday like did you grab my notebook and everyone's with no man not me like i didn't grab anything so find me a text the last person that was hanging out with us which was my friend who invited that justin dude over cuz i didn't have justin's number and yo yo did you or your friend justin accidentally take my notebook because it miss him and he's like no dude i didn't take anything i'll text justin right now i'm sorry okay cool so he texted justin justin didn't reply and my friend calls me he's like yo he's not replying let's just stop by his house and i was like are you sure he's like yeah i'm like all right man fine so my friend comes over and picks me up and we drive to this dude's house and my friend knocks on his door and his dad answers and my friends like hey like i was here yesterday i was on the pick justin up and was hanging out with them justin could have accidentally grabbed my friend's notebook and were just looking for it should i come in and look here could you look for it and his dad's like yeah i'll look for it what's it look like and i described to him what it looked like it was like it's just looks like a normal composition notebook he's like okay and he went up to his room we're sitting down there for like 10 minutes waiting and he comes down with like a stack of books like chapter books notebooks like paper sure like that and i was like what the fuck and in the middle i see it peeking out like the corner of it i'm like that kind of looks like it but you know that could just be any old notebook but i pointed to it and dad takes it out of the stack he's like is this it and i look on the front and it has a drawing that i put on it sounds like yep that's it and he hands it to me and he's like what is it anyway i'm like it's a notebook full of really like valuable stuff and i don't know why he took it and he's like well i know my son he wouldn't steal anything like it must have just been a misunderstanding and i was like i don't know about that because that notebook has passwords to all my social media accounts and when i woke up today one of them was deactivated and i was locked out of the other one and the only people that have those passwords are me and that notebook and your son had that notebook today he was like well why don't we just wait for him to come home he's gonna be home from his drum lesson soon and we just talked to him i was like okay so me and my friend went and grabbed food for like 20 minutes came back his dad invited us in and we just sat at his kitchen table pretty much just waiting for him to come home and like 15 minutes go by and all sudden we hear a car door slam and i was like yep he's home so me and my friend stood in front of the front door and right when it opened he saw us both and he's like oh yo like hey guys are you guys doing here and i was like yo where's my notebook he's like what notebook i'm like where is it he's like i don't have your notebook and his dad comes around the corner he's like hey what's up like you took this kid's notebook on accident he's like no i didn't and i was okay then follow me and he follows me over to the kitchen table and there it is just sitting on the table i go that's my notebook you stole it yesterday here i didn't steal anything like it was an accident i'm like you just accidentally won on my bookshelf and took it he's like dude i'm telling you like it was an accident okay just just tell me why he took it he's like dude i didn't steal it and then his own father says well how to end up in your room man i found in your room and i was like dude your own dad agrees that you took it like come on just tell me why he's like all right look i watched your videos like a year back and i can't remember where i heard it it might have been on youtube or like on a stream or something but you were talking about how you had this like notebook full of passwords and like it's got all your stuff in it and like it's valuable and people try to take it and i was like so you decided to just like conspire against me and fucking steal it he's like yeah i was like and what was your plan with my social media what were gonna do with it he's like i don't know and before i could say anything else his dad goes give me your car keys and he throws his keys his dad and his dad puts him in his back pocket and he goes i'm so sorry and he said it to me i was like it's all good it's not your fault and like his own dad knew that he was in the wrong and like took his car from him and pretty much yeah like he saw in a video or like on social media that i talked about the notebook before which was my fault i should never have mentioned that and i probably should have changed my passwords more often and you probably austin why didn't you have to step on your stuff well my lazy dumb ass did have to step on everything but around this time i actually just changed my phone number so i had to like transfer it to a different phone and change the number on my accounts and i forgot to for that week and like my instagram and twitter it didn't have it on but the one thing i did immediately was put to stuff on my youtube so my only social media that had to step was my youtube and if it would have never had to step my own channel click on fucking deleted and like that would just be fucking horrible so luckily that was the one area i was smart and around this time so after that i just kept confronting him i was like all right so give me the passwords of my instant twitter because i know you messed with him this morning and he's alright and he gave them to me and i reactivated my twitter and i secured my insta and secured my twitter and after that i just left so like dude fuck this like i have no other business being here so i went home changed all my passwords and all my stuff again like i must have changed my password probably like three or four times that day and then i made sure everything was secure and put two-step on everything because my dumb ass didn't have to step on insta and twitter that week you're probably wondering why don't you have to step on well i changed my phone number that week and my dumbass forgot to put the new number on the accounts so it didn't have to step on it and my youtube luckily the day i changed my number i put the new number on my youtube with two step immediately so luckily that was the one area i was smartened because if i didn't have to step on that youtube channel that morning my youtube could have been deleted for all i know like that was probably his plan like he already got my twitter taken down that day so like who knows what i'll see what have done but yeah my sort of got reactivated because he didn't fully delete it it's got deactivated and my instagram was okay he just changed the password on that got that backed and my youtube in the end was okay as well i guess more the story is don't be stupid like me like you literally just like change your passwords here and there keep to step on and don't be a dumbass like me i learned my lesson and don't steal shit don't be stealing my notebook you're probably like alright well i'm gonna come to lunas house and steal his notebook well guess what i don't have that notebook anymore now i keep my passwords actually know what i'm not gonna tell you where i keep my password that would i'm a fucking idiot alright guys hope you enjoyed the story time if you did leave a like on the video i would really appreciate it leave your guys's stories in the
